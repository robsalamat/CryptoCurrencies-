# CryptoCurrencies

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
We are tasked with helping out Martha to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies in order to discover a trend that will convince her firm, Accountability Accounting, to invest in these new currencies.

### Objective
The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked for a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
